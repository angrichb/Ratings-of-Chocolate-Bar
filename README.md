# Ratings-of-Chocolate-Bar

# Objective
The objective of my project is to explore factors that influence expert ratings of chocolate bars. By visualizing relationships between chocolate bar characteristics (such as cocoa percentage, bean origin, and company location) and their ratings, this analysis seeks to uncover trends that may inform product quality, sourcing decisions, and market positioning.
